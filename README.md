    S - moves the blocks down quickly
    D - moves the tetrimions right
    J - rotates the tetriminos left
    k - rotates the tetriminos right

As the game progresses next pice will be displayed in the top right of the screen. The faster you move the pices the more points 
you will score. You can also score points by breaking full lines. The more lines you break at once the more points you will score.

There is a leader board that holds the top 5 highest scores. The leader board resets after the application is restarted.
There is a reset game button on the page so you and your firends can compete for the high score.

GOOD LUCK!!
